# AOC 2023 advent of code 2k23 
This repo contain my solution of advent of code

- For each day i created a different folder 
- each folder contain three files `answer.py`, `question.md` and `input.txt`
  - `answer.py` -> contain answer of the problem (as of now i have only written first part of each problem)
  - `question.md` -> question text from advent of code site 
  - `input.txt` -> input for the problem 
- all code written in `python 3.11`
